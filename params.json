{"name":"Linux Command Line","tagline":"","body":"## An Introduction to Shell Scripting\r\nScientific and engineering programmers sooner or later encounter the command line.  Although unfamiliar, the command line offers unprecedented power and precision for even common tasks in data access, formatting, analysis, and processing.  This short course is designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of the shell syntax through exercises and case studies.\r\n\r\nThis course is not an introduction to programming, nor is it intended to replace courses such as CS 101 which introduce programming concepts.  We will discuss aspects of basic programming, but this course is strongly oriented towards accomplishing basic practical tasks which science and engineering students and researchers may encounter.\r\n\r\n## First Section (10–11 March)\r\n\r\n## Second Section (17–18 March)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
