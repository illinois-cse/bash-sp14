{"name":"Linux Command Line","tagline":"","body":"## An Introduction to Shell Scripting\r\nScientific and engineering programmers sooner or later encounter the command line.  Although unfamiliar, the command line offers unprecedented power and precision for even common tasks in data access, formatting, analysis, and processing.  This short course is designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of the shell syntax through exercises and case studies.\r\n\r\nThis course is not an introduction to programming, nor is it intended to replace courses such as CS 101 which introduce programming concepts.  We will discuss aspects of basic programming, but this course is strongly oriented towards accomplishing basic practical tasks which science and engineering students and researchers may encounter.\r\n\r\n## Course Content\r\nWe will be working in the EWS Linux computer lab DCL L440.  If you want to bring your own computer, please follow these instructions to get set up:\r\n\r\n*Linux*:  You're good to go.  Just know how to access your terminal.\r\n\r\n*Mac OS X*:  You will use Terminal.app, location in your `/Applications` folder.\r\n\r\n*Windows*:  This situation is a little more complicated.  The best Windows-based solution is to download and install [`mSysGit`](http://msysgit.github.io/) [(alternate link)](http://www.git-scm.com/downloads), which includes Git Bash, a command-line interface suitable for 90% of the commands we need.\r\n\r\n## Exercises\r\nPlease download the .TAR.GZ file linked in the site header to your Desktop/ folder.\r\n\r\n[Day 1](https://github.com/uiuc-cse/bash-sp14/blob/master/exercises.pdf?raw=true)\r\n\r\n[Day 2](https://github.com/uiuc-cse/bash-sp14/blob/master/exercises-2.pdf?raw=true)\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n[Neal Davis](http://cse.illinois.edu/training) developed these materials for [Computational Science and Engineering](http://cse.illinois.edu) at the [University of Illinois](http://illinois.edu).
